/**
 * Turning issue keys an agent mentions into links you can open.
 *
 * Agents cite tickets constantly — "ACME-383 has the wrong parent" — and until
 * now that was a dead string you retyped into a browser. It is a link now, and
 * `MarkdownView` already renders links with `target="_blank"`, which
 * `security.ts` turns into `shell.openExternal`. So nothing new is trusted: the
 * href goes through the same https-only path every other link in a transcript
 * already takes.
 *
 * **Why a key list rather than a pattern.** The obvious rule — two or more
 * capitals, a hyphen, digits — is wrong in exactly this app. `UTF-8`, `ISO-8601`,
 * `SHA-256` and `RFC-2119` all match it, and a transcript full of coding agents
 * is the single most likely place on earth to contain all four. Linkifying those
 * would send you to a 404 and, worse, make the real ticket links untrustworthy.
 * Matching only keys that are known to exist costs one line of configuration and
 * removes the whole class of error.

 * The tracker this workspace's agents talk about. Empty, so nothing linkifies.

 * **Off by default on purpose.** A tracker is one workspace's private fact — its
 * host names the company and its keys name the projects — so there is no honest
 * default to ship. An empty key list is the one setting that is correct for
 * everybody: `keyPattern` returns `null` for it and `linkifyIssues` hands the
 * nodes straight back, so the feature costs nothing until someone fills it in.
 *
 * A constant rather than a settings field, still, because the UI to edit it is
 * more surface than the fact deserves. `linkifyIssues` and `issueHref` both take
 * the tracker as an argument, so moving it into `SettingsShape` changes this
 * file's callers and nothing about its logic.
