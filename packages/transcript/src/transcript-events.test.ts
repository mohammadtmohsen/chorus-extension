   * The guard the type system does NOT give, and a review caught the gap twice.

   * `Record<ChorusEventType, …>` forces a *new* event type to be classified. It
   * says nothing about the other direction: adding a reducer case for a type
   * already marked `ignore` compiles cleanly, works through the live push —
   * which still carries every type — and then vanishes on replay, because the
   * read never asks for it. The bug would be a row that exists until you reopen
   * the conversation.
   *
   * The first version of this test fed each ignored type an **empty payload**,
   * which proves nothing: a future case reading real fields could return early
   * and leave it green. So `reduceEvents` now consults the map directly, and
   * this asserts that enforcement — with a payload rich enough to render, and a
   * control that proves it renders under a type marked `render`.
