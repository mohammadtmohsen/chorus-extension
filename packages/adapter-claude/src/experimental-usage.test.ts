/**
 * The one API here that says, in its own name, not to depend on it.
 *
 * `readPlanUsage` calls `usage_EXPERIMENTAL_MAY_CHANGE_DO_NOT_RELY_ON_THIS_API_YET`
 * to fill the account panel before a turn is spent. It is called defensively —
 * feature-detected, wrapped, absence treated as normal — so a rename cannot
 * crash anything. That is the right failure mode and also the dangerous one: the
 * panel simply stops filling, which looks like an account with no plan window,
 * and nothing anywhere says why.
 *
 * This is the canary. It reads the installed SDK's own type declarations and
 * fails when that name is gone — at the moment of the upgrade, in CI, with the
 * name to search for in the failure message. It cannot make the API stable; it
 * can make its disappearance loud.
